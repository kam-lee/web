        <p>
Enhancing the energy density of fuels and the controllability of thrust represents a continuous 
objective for researchers in aerospace propulsion. Powdered fuels, with magnesium and 
aluminum as prime examples, are assuming more significant roles in aerospace power systems 
due to their plentiful reserves, ease of transportation, and high combustion heat values. From a 
micro-perspective, these fuels combust within the engine's combustion chamber as single particle 
or as clusters formed from particle agglomeration. Investigating the ignition and combustion 
processes of single particles and developing a particle ignition and combustion model that can 
precisely forecast the thermal release during particle combustion is essential for guiding numerical 
simulations at the combustion chamber scale. Such models are instrumental for informing 
engine design, offering substantial value for both theoretical studies and practical applications. 
The Hypersonic Propulsion Laboratory has developed a controllable environment laminar 
combustion facility to conduct research on the combustion characteristics of single particles, 
exemplified by experiments involving the combustion of magnesium in carbon dioxide. <br>

        <p class="ita">Fig. 1 Schematic diagram of laminar combustion facility</p>
        <p>
 As illustrated in Fig. 1, particles are electrostatically charged and dispersed by an 
emission device located below, subsequently entering the combustion region above, which 
is characterized by a controlled atmosphere and temperature, via carrier gas. Upon laser 
ignition, the particles initiate combustion. The ensuing combustion process is subject to 
analysis through various diagnostic techniques, including high-speed imaging, pyrometry, 
and spectrometer.
<br><br>
In contrast to conventional flat-flame combustion apparatuses, the HPL's laminar combustion 
facility utilizes an electric heater to elevate the gas temperature, thereby decoupling the 
atmospheric composition from the temperature control. This methodology prevents the 
interference of polluting species, such as combustion byproducts, with the combustion 
process of the particles, which would otherwise be introduced when creating high-temperature 
environments.
<br><br>
The combustion modalities of magnesium particles in a CO2-rich environment are predominantly 
divided into four modes: surface reactions, vapor-phase combustion, micro-explosions, and 
flash out, as illustrated in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.
<br>
        </p>
        <p class="p-fl">
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Surface Reaction: The chemical reaction follows the reaction equation 
	Mg + CO2 → MgO + C. This mode is kinetically controlled, and the combustion temperature 
	is typically constrained below the boiling point of magnesium, as shown in Fig. 2(a). This 
	particular combustion mode is generally observed at the initial stage of the ignition process 
	when particle temperatures are comparatively low. Carbon dioxide, present in high 
	concentrations around the particle, permeates through the pores of the oxidation shell to reach 
	the magnesium core, where it engages in the reaction. Consequently, new layers of magnesium 
	oxide and solid carbon are formed at the inner surface of the initial oxidation shell, as illustrated 
	in Fig. 3(a).</p>
    <p class="p-fl">
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The vapor-phase combustion follows the reaction equation Mg + CO2 → MgO + CO, which is 
	controlled by diffusion processes. In accordance with the Dn power law, the combustion time tc 
	is empirically related to the initial particle diameter D by the expression tc=kD1.76. The 
	combustion temperature during this principal phase of burning generally surpasses the boiling 
	point of magnesium, as depicted in Fig. 2(b). After the particles heated up through the surface 
	reaction, a large amount of magnesium core evaporated, and the magnesium vapor diffused to 
	the outside of the oxide shell to react with carbon dioxide to form magnesium oxide and carbon 
	monoxide (Fig. 3 (b)). The carbon monoxide generated on the particle surface then reacts with 
	the molten magnesium core to form magnesium oxide and carbon on the outer surface of the 
	oxide shell (Fig. 3 (c)).</p>
    <p class="p-fl">
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The micro-explosion mode is mainly caused by the internal magnesium vapor pressure exceeding 
	the mechanical performance limit of the magnesium oxide shell during the vapor-phase combustion 
	stage. The magnesium vapor pierces through the vulnerable regions of the shell, creating a micro-jet 
	that reacts intensely with the surrounding carbon dioxide (Fig. 3(d)). The temperature preceding the 
	micro-explosion typically exceeds the boiling point of magnesium, with the combustion products 
	illustrated in Fig. 2(c). </p>
    <p class="p-fl">
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;	During the flash out mode, there is a precipitous decline in the particle's luminosity over an 
	exceedingly brief interval, which is indicative of unstable combustion. The temperature 
	during combustion exhibits pronounced variations but remains fundamentally below the 
	boiling point of magnesium, as depicted in Fig. 2(d). From a holistic perspective, the flash 
	out mode is categorized as a form of surface reaction.</p>
